/* Text Steve Patching Before I commenced Strength for Life I had pain in my neck and right shoulder most of the time and took Panamax before bed and during the night to prevent waking up with the pain. Now I rarely take Panamax, and only have an ache in the area at times. My strength has improved and I enjoy the company of others whilst we work out. Paula has done a wonderful job.
