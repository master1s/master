/* Text Jarrad Cranmer I have been going to the gym for 17 months now. I did not realise how much flexibility and balance I had lost. The training program has brought about a huge improvement. The gym is also an opportunity as a social occasion. The class gets together for coffee after the gym. Importantly, the instructors take an interest in your well being and progress.
